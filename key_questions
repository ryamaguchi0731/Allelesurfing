How do alleles surf in a moving hybrid zone; and does allele surfing reshape local adaptation?  

Do alleles at the front of hybrid zone movement surf as those at the population expansion edge?
Would introgressed alleles surf as the parental alleles at the wave front?
Would allele surfing-introgression interaction in moving hybrid zone on boost local adaptation?
How would reproductive isolation alter the surfing-introgression pattern. 
Would this interaction result in evolution of reproductive isolation? 

How do the aggression/plumage-related alleles distribute in moving hybrid zone?
