when will load be large
Migration rate: small (expansion dominant)
selection: intermediate (too small, not enough load; too big, mask drift effect)

Questions
1> why multiplicative
2> reproduction question: whether it will matter when to do selection
3> burnin 1000, mutation load equilibrium, if not at equil will change the dynamics?
