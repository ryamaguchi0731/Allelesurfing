when will load be large
Migration rate: small (expansion dominant)
selection: intermediate (too small, not enough load; too big, mask drift effect)


1D or 2D doesnt matter

Questions
1> why multiplicative
2> reproduction question: whether it will matter when to do selection
3> burnin 1000, mutation load equilibrium, if not at equil will change the dynamics?


Peischl 2015
Importance of studying allele surfing
"These findings may help explain many inter- esting phenomena, such as a reduced potential to adapt to novel environments (Pujol and Pannell 2008) and patterns of intraspecific variation in inbreeding depression (Pujol et al. 2009) and mutation load (Peischl et al. 2013)."

why use fitness-dependent growth rate
"First, there should be an absolute limit on the mutation load: individuals with too many del- eterious mutations will not be able to survive or repro- duce, independently of the fitness of conspecifics."
"Second, because the efficiency of selection on the wave front increases with decreasing growth rate (Hallatschek and Nel- son 2010; Peischl et al. 2013), 
there should be a negative feedback between the dynamics of expansion load and the expansion process itself."
