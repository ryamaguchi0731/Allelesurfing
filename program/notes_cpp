#selection
structure: 3 classes
1, class ind
  -vector1: loci: hybird loci and other loci  --> each locus is two dimensional (D1: chrom; D2:locus postion)
  -vector2: metrics (fitness, etc.) 
2, class parsSet
  -cluster parameter
  -ES =0 if the locus is wildtype, new mutations will have fitness consequenc
  -there is fitness cost
  
3, class pop 
  -number of individuals 
  -double (containing stats such as allele frequency etc.) 
  -calculations


void selection1 
    calculate fitness and use the fitness
